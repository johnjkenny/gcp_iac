# GCP-IaC

Google Cloud Platform Infrastructure as Code (IaC) project using Terraform and Ansible to deploy a Docker
application on a VM instance. The project is designed to be run from a local machine and uses Terraform to create a VM
instance and Ansible to configure the instance.


## Prerequisites
- GCP project access with Compute Engine API enabled
- Firewall tag `ssh` for SSH access (port 22) allowing 0.0.0/0 access (or your public IP address for higher security)
- Firewall tag `web` for HTTP access (port 80) allowing 0.0.0/0 access (or your public IP address for higher security)
- Service account with `Compute Admin` role assigned
- Service account key downloaded in JSON format.
- Python3.12 (only tested with 3.12, but prior versions might work)


## Limitations
This is for demonstration purpose only. It is to showcase how to use Terraform and Ansible together to deploy a Docker
application on GCP. It is not intended for production use. It is designed to deploy a single VM instance then configure
Docker and deploy an application that consists of three containers then run a quick test to verify the application is
working. The application consists of the following containers:
- Nginx
- PHP
- MySQL

The test involves running curl against port 80 of the VM instance. This will then hit the nginx container which will
proxy the request to the PHP container. The PHP container will then connect to the MySQL container to save the
requestors IP address in the database. The returned response will be the IP address of the requestor and a welcome
message with code 200.
